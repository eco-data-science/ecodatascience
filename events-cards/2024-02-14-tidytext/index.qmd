Working with dataframes and tabular data is straightforward in R, but what about working with unstructured text such as reports, websites, journal articles, and open-ended survey responses?  In this workshop we will explore the basics of working with text data in R, focusing on the `tidytext` and `stringr` packages.  We'll touch on regular expressions, quantifying term frequency, plotting word clouds, and performing sentiment analysis.

**Wednesday February 14, 11:30-1 PM**, [DREAM Lab UCSB Library](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/dreamlab) (RM 2322, Mountain side of the building on the second floor.)

GitHub is mainly known as a version control platform that facilitates collaborative coding. Effective collaboration (with yourself or colleagues) requires good communication. GitHub offers several features that can support communication and project management. During this workshop, we will talk and practice how to structure a GitHub repository, taking advantage of GitHub Issues, Projects, and informative READMEs as a way of documenting and communicating your work process.


**Tuesday December 5, 11:30-1 PM**, DREAM Lab UCSB Library (RM 2322, Mountain side of the building on the second floor.)

Rasters are commonly used to represent continuous spatial data such as elevation and temperature. This workshop will give a gentle introduction to using the R package `terra` to manipulate and plot raster data. No prior knowledge of spatial data is needed, but basic familiarity with R is assumed. For those migrating from `terra`'s predecessor package `raster`, I will describe some of the changes to functions.


**Tuesday May 14, 3:00 PM**, Remote attendance only (Zoom link TBD)<!--[DREAM Lab UCSB Library](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/dreamlab){target='_blank'} (RM 2322, Mountain side of the building on the second floor.)-->

<!-- [**RSVP HERE** please!](xxxxx){target='_blank'} -->

Pre-workshop prep: TBD (RSVP to get an email and Zoom link)

<!-- * Install these packages, if not already installed: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `patchwork`, `sf`, `ggspatial`, `maptiles`, `terra`, `tidyterra`, `tigris`, `prettymapr`, `cowplot`, `rosm` -->
<!-- * See the "Installing" section for help with installation of the `sf` package at [https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), as `sf` also requires installation of GDAL, GEOS, and PROJ  -->

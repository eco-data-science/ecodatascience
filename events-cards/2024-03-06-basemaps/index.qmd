R can be a powerful tool for visualizing spatial data. In this workshop, we will review the basics of working with vector spatial data in R using the `sf` package, demonstrate how to make simple maps with `ggplot2`, and show different ways to add basemaps to your visualizations.



**Wednesday March 6, 11:30-1 PM**, [DREAM Lab UCSB Library](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/dreamlab) (RM 2322, Mountain side of the building on the second floor.)

Pre-workshop prep: 

* Install these packages, if not already installed: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `patchwork`, `sf`, `ggspatial`, `maptiles`, `terra`, `tidyterra`, `tigris`, `prettymapr`, `cowplot`, `rosm`
* See the "Installing" section for help with installation of the `sf` package at [https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), as `sf` also requires installation of GDAL, GEOS, and PROJ 
* Fork and clone this repository for workshop materials and data: [2024-03-06-spatial-data-viz](https://github.com/ecodatascience/2024-03-06-spatial-data-viz){target='_blank'}

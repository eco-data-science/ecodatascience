The `tidymodels` package streamlines many aspects of statistical modeling and machine learning in R, using `tidyverse` principles.  This workshop will be a gentle introduction to the `tidymodels` package and how we can use it to set up simple models and select the best among competing models - a fundamental idea behind machine learning.

Pre-workshop prep: 

1. install the `tidymodels` package
2. fork and clone this repository: [2023-11-07-tidymodels_workshop](https://github.com/ecodatascience/2023-11-07-tidymodels_workshop)

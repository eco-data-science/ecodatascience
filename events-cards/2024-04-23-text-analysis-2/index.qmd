Building on skills learned in our intro to `tidytext` in R, in this workshop we will explore more advanced text mining and natural language processing techniques to extract information and make meaning of unstructured text, including topic modeling: using relationships between words in a collection of documents to identify clusters of common themes.

If you are interested in this workshop but new to text analysis, or need a refresher, we recommend working through the scripts from last quarter's [`tidytext` workshop](https://github.com/ecodatascience/2024-02-14-tidytext){target='_blank'} to prepare for the current workshop.

**Tuesday April 23, 11:30-1 PM**, [DREAM Lab UCSB Library](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/dreamlab){target='_blank'} (RM 2322, Mountain side of the building on the second floor.)

[**RSVP HERE** please (for in-person or remote)!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevIH9RGPclfzhF3Od4BdDedHYBrUPCLhjTcKgGFpp4977QIQ/viewform){target='_blank'}

Pre-workshop prep: 

* Install these packages, if not already installed: `tidyverse`, `tidytext`, `synthesisr`, `topicmodels`, `ggwordcloud`
* Fork and clone this repository for workshop materials and data: [2024-04-23-natural-language-processing](https://github.com/ecodatascience/2024-04-23-natural-language-processing){target='_blank'}

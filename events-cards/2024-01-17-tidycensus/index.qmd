Working with census data can be tedious; you generally have to go to data.census.gov, filter data and queries based on variables and geographies, download data into a spreadsheet, upload it to R, etc. The `tidycensus` package ([Walker and Herman 2021](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/)) was developed to systematize this process using R. During this session, we will review the general structure of the U.S Census, introduce the main functions of the `tidycensus` to access census data efficiently and use `ggplot2` to plot and map this data at different census geographies (state, county, tract. etc.).

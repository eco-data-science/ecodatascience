While our members span the globe, our main focus is on serving the UCSB community, so many of the resources here focus on the Santa Barbara area, but we have included links to parent organizations for our members who live, work, and play remotely. Follow the links for more information, or start a discussion about these various resources in the EcoDataScience Slack workspace!\n\nThe Carpentries (SB org | global org teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.\nR-Ladies (SB chapter | global org) is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community.\nOpenScapes is an approach and a movement that helps researchers and those supporting research find each other and feel empowered to conduct data-intensive science.\n\nIf you represent an organization with a similar mission, please reach out and we will include a link!"

While we primarily support reproducible coding and workflows using R/RStudio in conjunction with Git/GitHub, our membership includes and welcomes newbies, practitioners, and experts in other languages, workflows, and development environments.\nOur organization was founded by researchers at NCEAS and UCSB’s Bren School in 2015, and our membership now includes over 500 members all over the world!\nWe are committed to maintaining a safe, welcoming, inclusive environment for all people at all levels of coding experience. All community members are expected to abide by our Code of Conduct in all interactions within the community."

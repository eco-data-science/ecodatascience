The members of EcoDataScience learn, teach, collaborate, and support one another through our community-led workshops and Slack workspace. While we primarily support reproducible coding and workflows using [R/RStudio in conjunction with Git/GitHub](welcome.html), our membership includes and welcomes [newbies](welcome.html), practitioners, and experts in other languages, workflows, and development environments.

Our organization was founded by researchers at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu){target="_blank"} and UCSB's [Bren School](https://www.bren.ucsb.edu){target="_blank"} in 2015, and our membership now includes over 500 members all over the world!

We are committed to maintaining a safe, welcoming, inclusive environment for all people at all levels of coding experience. All community members are expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.html) in all interactions within the community.
